Reading Resistor Color Band Codes with Photo Analysis

## What is RRCBWPA. :crystal_ball: :crystal_ball:	:crystal_ball:
RRCBWPA is an undergraduate thesis project for Helping user can use photos to process resistor color code values

## language of development. :balloon: :balloon: :balloon:
- [Python](https://www.python.org)

### RRCBWPA Necessary packages. :gem:
- [Open CV](https://opencv.org/) OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being an Apache 2 licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.
- [tkinter filedialog](https://pythonbasics.org/tkinter-filedialog/) Python Tkinter (and TK) offer a set of dialogs that you can use when working with files. By using these you don’t have to design standard dialogs your self. Example dialogs include an open file dialog, a save file dialog and many others. Besides file dialogs there are other standard dialogs, but in this article we will focus on file dialogs.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org) NumPy is an open source project that enables numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005 building on the early work of the Numeric and Numarray libraries. NumPy will always be 100% open source software and free for all to use. It is released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.
- [ply](https://pillow.readthedocs.io) PIL is the Python Imaging Library
- [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)The math module is a standard module in Python and is always available. To use mathematical functions under this module

## Prequistics. :bulb:
### Check the required versions. :pushpin: :pushpin: :pushpin:
First, check the required versions.

- Python.
  You can check by typing
  ```
  python –version.
  ```
  into the terminal.

## Running the application. :mag_right:
- Install.
  python dependencies in the project. Then open terminals and run these commands from the root of the project.
  ```
  python resistor_calculate.py
